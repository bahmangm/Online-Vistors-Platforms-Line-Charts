I implemented this chart in Power BI after downloading the data, importing it into Power BI, and performing some preprocessing steps to prepare the data for visualization, such as creating new columns from the date column and changing formats to percentage.

<b>Insights</b>

In both regions, the patterns are similar; for example, the popularity of Desktop platforms decreased over time, while the usage of Mobile devices increased. However, the timing of these developments differs; for example, in the US, the Mobile platform overtook the Desktop platform around 2019, while in Asia, it happened in 2015. Additionally, in the US, Desktop devices are used as much as Mobiles, but in Asia, the preference for the Mobile platform is twice as high.
